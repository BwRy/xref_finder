xref_finder
===========
xref_finder is a pair of tools that can be used for adding cross-references
into an IDA Pro database that can't be identified using strictly static 
analysis, such as virtual calls (i.e. `call eax`). Using Pin to do the 
heavy lifting gives huge performance gains over a debugger. As a by-product
of adding new cross-references, it's likely that IDA may auto-identify
new functions as well. The idea was inspired byPortnoy's writeup on 
scripting the creation of xrefs using IDAPython 
(http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/blog/2012/02/23/adding-xrefs-via-idapy).

The first, xref_finder, is a Pin tool, which must be compiled and executed
using Pin (http://www.pintool.org/). Running the desired executable with 
xref_finder will generate a log of caller to callee mappings.

The second, xref_parser, is an IDAPython plugin which parses this log, 
determines whether or not a particular mapping is eligible to be added as
a cross-reference (valid address range, is not an existing cross-reference)
and adds the cross-references accordingly. To highlight what new cross-
references have been built, the script will add regular comments next to
each "call" instruction.

This tool is intended to solve a very specific purpose, but Pin and 
IDAPython could be further utilized to do a lot more interesting things.

Pre-requisites
-----------
These tools are designed for use with IDA Pro. You'll also need IDAPython
and Pin. For testing, I compiled the tool using Visual Studio 2010, but 
you shouldn't have [much of] a problem using some other compiler on some 
other operating system.

Building the Pin tool
-----------
Note: This Pin tool has only been tested on Windows, using Visual Studio 
2010. 

Move the xref_finder directory into the source/tools/ directory within your
Pin directory. From a Visual Studio command prompt, change into the 
xref_finder directory and simply type `nmake`. By default, the resulting
tool can be found within a new "obj-ia32" directory (on x86 architecture).

Running the Pin tool
-----------
Pin tools are essentially libraries, intended to be used with the Pin 
application. From your Pin directory, run something like the following.

`pin -t path\to\xref_finder.dll -- calc.exe`

In this example, "calc.exe" will launch and a file called `xrefs_omg.out` 
will be created in the directory from which Pin was run.

The tool doesn't account for child processes (yet?) so mileage may vary.

Running the IDAPython script
-----------
I suspect that this is self-explanatory. Suck in the output the xref_finder
output (by default, `xref_omg.out`).

Quirks
-----------
There may be some. They may be more obvious to you than to me. Because I 
wrote this tool to actually use, I am interested in improving its 
functionality and reliability. There's a very good chance that you are a
better Python and/or C++ programmer with a better understanding of how
software works. Please be sure to share any suggestions, comments, or
criticisms.
